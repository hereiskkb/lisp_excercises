Some exercises problems while I learn the art of Lisping

I have been trying to learn programming in Common Lisp for about 3 years now. So last year I picked up "Common LISP: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation" and have been going chapter to chapter, solving all the problems as best as I can. This repository is a collection of my solved exercises. 

I haven't really followed any order, so don't expect any.
