I am going to write down the craziest idea that I have:
1. Make a collective of all the aerospace companies in India
2. Devise solutions to create space colonies in space, as in:
	a. Moon Base
	b. Moon Orbiting Station
	c. Mars base
	d. Mars Orbiting Station
	e. Venus Orbiting Station -> Optional
	f. Asteroid Mining Rigs.
	g. Deep space Probes.
	h. Earth Orbiting station to replace ISS, bigger, better.
	i. Relay communication network with near earth satellite system.
	j. Asteroid ferry system.
	k. Space tourism launches, cheap, viable and frequent.
	l. Outer solar system probes.
	m. Solar observatory.
3. At the core of each of these spacecrafts and missions has be
standardized ports, components with mix and match capabilities.
This will enable greater international cooperation, and accelarated
operational framework.
